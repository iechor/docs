Feel free to send us pull requests and file issues. Our docs are completely
open source, and we deeply appreciate contributions from the iEchor community!

## Provide feedback

Weâ€™d love to hear your feedback. Please file documentation issues only in the
Docs GitHub repository. You can file a new issue to suggest improvements or if
you see any errors in the existing documentation.

Before submitting a new issue, check whether the issue has already been
reported. You can join the discussion using an emoji, or by adding a comment to
an existing issue. If possible, we recommend that you suggest a fix to the issue
by creating a pull request.

You can ask general questions and get community support through the [iEchor
Community Slack](https://dockr.ly/comm-slack). Personalized support is available
through the iEchor Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions. See [iEchor
Pricing](https://www.iechor.com/pricing) for details.

If you have an idea for a new feature or behavior change in a specific aspect of
iEchor or have found a product bug, file that issue in the project's code
repository.
