description: Learn how to build your first Rust iEchor image
---

## Prerequisites

* You have installed the latest version of [iEchor Desktop](../../get-iechor.md).
* You have a [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The examples in this section use a command-line based git client, but you can use any client.

## Overview

This guide walks you through building your first Rust image. An image
includes everything needed to run an application - the code or binary, runtime,
dependencies, and any other file system objects required.

## Get the sample application

Clone the sample application to use with this guide. Open a terminal, change directory to a directory that you want to work in, and run the following command to clone the repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/iechor/iechor-rust-hello
```

## Create a iEchorfile for Rust

Now that you have an application, you can use `iechor init` to create a
iEchorfile for it. Inside the `iechor-rust-hello` directory, run the `iechor
init` command. `iechor init` provides some default configuration, but you'll
need to answer a few questions about your application. Refer to the following
example to answer the prompts from `iechor init` and use the same answers for
your prompts.

```console
$ iechor init
Welcome to the iEchor Init CLI!

This utility will walk you through creating the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
  - .iechorignore
  - iEchorfile
  - compose.yaml
  - README.iEchor.md

Let's get started!

? What application platform does your project use? Rust
? What version of Rust do you want to use? 1.70.0
? What port does your server listen on? 8000
```

You should now have the following new files in your `iechor-rust-hello`
directory:
 - iEchorfile
 - .iechorignore
 - compose.yaml
 - README.iEchor.md

For building an image, only the iEchorfile is necessary. Open the iEchorfile
in your favorite IDE or text editor and see what it contains. To learn more
about iEchorfiles, see the [iEchorfile reference](../../reference/iechorfile.md).

## .iechorignore file

When you run `iechor init`, it also creates a [`.iechorignore`](../../reference/iechorfile.md#iechorignore-file) file. Use the `.iechorignore` file to specify patterns and paths that you don't want copied into the image in order to keep the image as small as possible. Open up the `.iechorignore` file in your favorite IDE or text editor and see what's inside already.

## Build an image

Now that youâ€™ve created the iEchorfile, you can build the image. To do this, use
the `iechor build` command. The `iechor build` command builds iEchor images from
a iEchorfile and a context. A build's context is the set of files located in
the specified PATH or URL. The iEchor build process can access any of the files
located in this context.

The build command optionally takes a `--tag` flag. The tag sets the name of the
image and an optional tag in the format `name:tag`. If you don't pass a tag,
iEchor uses "latest" as its default tag.

Build the iEchor image.

```console
$ iechor build --tag iechor-rust-image .
```

You should see output like the following.

## View local images

To see a list of images you have on your local machine, you have two options. One is to use the iEchor CLI and the other is to use [iEchor Desktop](../../desktop/use-desktop/images.md). As you are working in the terminal already, take a look at listing images using the CLI.

To list images, run the `iechor images` command.

```console
$ iechor images
REPOSITORY                TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
iechor-rust-image         latest            8cae92a8fbd6   3 minutes ago   123MB
```

You should see at least one image listed, including the image you just built `iechor-rust-image:latest`.

## Tag images

As mentioned earlier, an image name is made up of slash-separated name components. Name components may contain lowercase letters, digits, and separators. A separator can include a period, one or two underscores, or one or more dashes. A name component may not start or end with a separator.

An image is made up of a manifest and a list of layers. Don't worry too much about manifests and layers at this point other than a "tag" points to a combination of these artifacts. You can have multiple tags for an image. Create a second tag for the image you built and take a look at its layers.

To create a new tag for the image you built, run the following command.

```console
$ iechor tag iechor-rust-image:latest iechor-rust-image:v1.0.0
```

The `iechor tag` command creates a new tag for an image. It doesn't create a new image. The tag points to the same image and is just another way to reference the image.

Now, run the `iechor images` command to see a list of the local images.

```console
$ iechor images
REPOSITORY                TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
iechor-rust-image         latest            8cae92a8fbd6   4 minutes ago   123MB
iechor-rust-image         v1.0.0            8cae92a8fbd6   4 minutes ago   123MB
rust                      latest            be5d294735c6   4 minutes ago   113MB
```

You can see that two images start with `iechor-rust-image`. You know they're the same image because if you take a look at the `IMAGE ID` column, you can see that the values are the same for the two images.

Remove the tag you just created. To do this, use the `rmi` command. The `rmi` command stands for remove image.

```console
$ iechor rmi iechor-rust-image:v1.0.0
Untagged: iechor-rust-image:v1.0.0
```

Note that the response from iEchor tells you that iEchor didn't remove the image, but only "untagged" it. You can check this by running the `iechor images` command.

```console
$ iechor images
REPOSITORY               TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
iechor-rust-image        latest            8cae92a8fbd6   6 minutes ago   123MB
rust                     latest            be5d294735c6   6 minutes ago   113MB
```

iEchor removed the image tagged with `:v1.0.0`, but the `iechor-rust-image:latest` tag is available on your machine.

## Summary

This section showed how you can use `iechor init` to create a iEchorfile and .iechorignore file for a Rust application. It then showed you how to build an image. And finally, it showed you how to tag an image and list all images.
