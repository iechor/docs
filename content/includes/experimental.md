Experimental features provide early access to future product functionality.
These features are intended for testing and feedback only as they may change
between releases without warning or can be removed entirely from a future
release. Experimental features must not be used in production environments.
iEchor does not offer support for experimental features.

For a list of current experimental features in the iEchor CLI, see [iEchor CLI Experimental features](https://github.com/iechor/cli/blob/master/experimental/README.md).
