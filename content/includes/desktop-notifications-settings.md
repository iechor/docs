Use the **Notifications** tab to turn on or turn off notifications for the following events:

- **Status updates on tasks and processes**
- **iEchor announcements**
- **iEchor surveys**

By default, all notifications are turned on. You'll always receive error notifications and notifications about new iEchor Desktop releases and updates.

Notifications momentarily appear in the lower-right of the iEchor Dashboard and then move to the **Notifications** drawer. To open the **Notifications** drawer, select {{< inline-image src="../images/notifications.svg" alt="notifications" >}}.
