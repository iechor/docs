When you upgrade to a paid subscription, you immediately have access to all the features and entitlements available in your new chosen subscription. For detailed information on features available in each subscription, see [iEchor Pricing](https://www.iechor.com/pricing).

## Upgrade your subscription 

1. Sign in to your [iEchor Hub](https://hub.iechor.com) account.

2. Optional: If you're upgrading from a free user account to a Team subscription and want to keep your account name, [convert your user account into an organization](../../admin/convert-account.md).

3. Select your avatar in the top-right corner of iEchor Hub.

4. From the drop-down menu select **Billing**, then the account you want to upgrade.

5. Go to your current plan, then select **Change plan** and then choose the plan you'd like to upgrade to.

   > **Tip**
   >
   > If your current plan is a free plan, select **Buy now**.
