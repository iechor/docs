## 18.09.1

2019-01-09

#### Important notes about this release

In iEchor versions prior to 18.09, containerd was managed by the iEchor engine daemon. In iEchor Engine 18.09, containerd is managed by systemd. Since containerd is managed by systemd, any custom configuration to the `iechor.service` systemd configuration which changes mount settings (for example, `MountFlags=slave`) breaks interactions between the iEchor Engine daemon and containerd, and you will not be able to start containers.

Run the following command to get the current value of the `MountFlags` property for the `iechor.service`:

```console
$ sudo systemctl show --property=MountFlags iechor.service
MountFlags=
```

Update your configuration if this command prints a non-empty value for `MountFlags`, and restart the iechor service.

### Security fixes
* Upgraded Go language to 1.10.6 to resolve [CVE-2018-16873](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16873), [CVE-2018-16874](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16874), and [CVE-2018-16875](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16875).
* Fixed authz plugin for 0-length content and path validation.
* Added `/proc/asound` to masked paths [iechor/engine#126](https://github.com/iechor/engine/pull/126)

* Provided additional warnings for use of deprecated legacy overlay and devicemapper storage drivers [iechor/engine#85](https://github.com/iechor/engine/pull/85)
* prune: perform image pruning before build cache pruning [iechor/cli#1532](https://github.com/iechor/cli/pull/1532)
* Added bash completion for experimental CLI commands (manifest) [iechor/cli#1542](https://github.com/iechor/cli/pull/1542)
* Windows: allow process isolation on Windows 10 [iechor/engine#81](https://github.com/iechor/engine/pull/81)

* There are important changes to the upgrade process that, if not correctly followed, can have impact on the availability of applications running on the Swarm during upgrades. These constraints impact any upgrades coming from any version before 18.09 to version 18.09 or greater.

### Known Issues

* There are important changes to the upgrade process that, if not correctly followed, can have impact on the availability of applications running on the Swarm during upgrades. These constraints impact any upgrades coming from any version before 18.09 to version 18.09 or greater.
* With https://github.com/boot2iechor/boot2iechor/releases/download/v18.09.0/boot2iechor.iso, connection is being refused from a node on the virtual machine. Any publishing of swarm ports in virtualbox-created iechor-machine VM's will not respond. This is occurring on macOS and Windows 10, using iechor-machine version 0.15 and 0.16.

   The following `iechor run` command works, allowing access from host browser:

   `iechor run -d -p 4000:80 nginx`

   However, the following `iechor service` command fails, resulting in curl/chrome unable to connect (connection refused):

   `iechor service create -p 5000:80 nginx`

   This issue is not apparent when provisioning 18.09.0 cloud VM's using iechor-machine.

   Workarounds:
   * Use cloud VM's that don't rely on boot2iechor.
   * `iechor run` is unaffected.
   * For Swarm, set VIRTUALBOX_BOOT2IECHOR_URL=https://github.com/boot2iechor/boot2iechor/releases/download/v18.06.1-ce/boot2iechor.iso.

   This issue is resolved in 18.09.1.

### Deprecation Notices

- iEchor has deprecated support for Device Mapper as a storage driver. It will continue to be
supported at this time, but support will be removed in a future release.

    The [Overlay2 storage driver](../../storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver.md) is now the default for iEchor engine implementations.

For more information on the list of deprecated flags and APIs, have a look at the [deprecation information](/engine/deprecated/) where you can find the target removal dates.

### End of Life Notification

In this release, iEchor has also removed support for TLS < 1.2 [moby/moby#37660](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/37660),
