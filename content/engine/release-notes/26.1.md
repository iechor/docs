- When the internal DNS server's own address is supplied as an external server address, ignore it to avoid unproductive recursion. [moby/moby#47833](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47833)

### Packaging updates

## 26.1.1

{{< release-date date="2024-04-30" >}}

For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:

- [iechor/cli, 26.1.1 milestone](https://github.com/iechor/cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A26.1.1)
- [moby/moby, 26.1.1 milestone](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A26.1.1)
- Deprecated and removed features, see [Deprecated Features](https://github.com/iechor/cli/blob/v26.1.1/docs/deprecated.md).
- Changes to the Engine API, see [API version history](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v26.1.1/docs/api/version-history.md).

### Bug fixes and enhancements

- Fix `iechor run -d` printing an `context canceled` spurious error when OpenTelemetry is configured. [iechor/cli#5044](https://github.com/iechor/cli/pull/5044)
- Experimental environment variable `IECHOR_BRIDGE_PRESERVE_KERNEL_LL=1` will prevent the daemon from removing the kernel-assigned link local address on a Linux bridge. [moby/moby#47775](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47775)
- Resolve an issue preventing container creation on hosts with a read-only `/proc/sys/net` filesystem. If IPv6 cannot be disabled on an interface due to this, either disable IPv6 by default on the host or ensure `/proc/sys/net` is read-write. To bypass the error, set the environment variable `IECHOR_ALLOW_IPV6_ON_IPV4_INTERFACE=1` before starting the iEchor daemon. [moby/moby#47769](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47769)

> **Note**
>
> The `IECHOR_ALLOW_IPV6_ON_IPV4_INTERFACE` is added as a temporary fix and will be phased out in a future major release, when the IPv6 enablement process has been improved.

### Packaging updates

- Update BuildKit to [v0.13.2](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/v0.13.2). [moby/moby#47762](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47762)
- Update Compose to [v2.27.0](https://github.com/iechor/compose/releases/tag/v2.27.0). [iechor/iechor-ce-packages#1017](https://github.com/iechor/iechor-ce-packaging/pull/1017)


## 26.1.0

{{< release-date date="2024-04-22" >}}

For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:

- [iechor/cli, 26.1.0 milestone](https://github.com/iechor/cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A26.1.0)
- [moby/moby, 26.1.0 milestone](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A26.1.0)
- Deprecated and removed features, see [Deprecated Features](https://github.com/iechor/cli/blob/v26.1.0/docs/deprecated.md).
- Changes to the Engine API, see [API version history](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v26.1.0/docs/api/version-history.md).

### New

- Added configurable OpenTelemetry utilities and basic instrumentation to commands.
  For more information, see [OpenTelemetry for the iEchor CLI](http://docs.iechor.com/config/otel). [iechor/cli#4889](https://github.com/iechor/cli/pull/4889)

### Bug fixes and enhancements

- Native Windows containers are configured with an internal DNS server for container name resolution, and external DNS servers for other lookups.
  Not all resolvers, including `nslookup`, fall back to the external resolvers when they get a `SERVFAIL` answer from the internal server.
  So, the internal DNS server can now be configured to forward requests to the external resolvers, by setting a `feature` option in the `daemon.json` file:

  ```json
  {
    "features": {
      "windows-dns-proxy": true
    }
  }
  ```

  [moby/moby#47584](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47584)

  > **Note**
  >
  > - This will be the new default behavior in iEchor Engine 27.0.
  > - The `windows-dns-proxy` feature flag will be removed in a future release.

- Swarm: Fix `Subpath` not being passed to the container config. [moby/moby#47711](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47711)
- Classic builder: Fix cache miss on `WORKDIR <directory>/` build step (directory with a trailing slash). [moby/moby#47723](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47723)
- containerd image store: Fix `iechor images` failing when any image in the store has unexpected target. [moby/moby#47738](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47738)
