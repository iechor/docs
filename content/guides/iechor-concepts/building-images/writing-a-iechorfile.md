## Explanation

A iEchorfile is a text-based document that's used to create a container image. It provides instructions to the image builder on the commands to run, files to copy, startup command, and more.

As an example, the following iEchorfile would produce a ready-to-run Python application:

```iechorfile
FROM python:3.12
WORKDIR /usr/local/app

# Install the application dependencies
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy in the source code
COPY src ./src
EXPOSE 5000

# Setup an app user so the container doesn't run as the root user
RUN useradd app
USER app

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

### Common instructions

Some of the most common instructions in a `iEchorfile` include:

- `FROM <image>` - this specifies the base image that the build will extend.
- `WORKDIR <path>` - this instruction specifies the "working directory" or the path in the image where files will be copied and commands will be executed.
- `COPY <host-path> <image-path>` - this instruction tells the builder to copy files from the host and put them into the container image.
- `RUN <command>` - this instruction tells the builder to run the specified command.
- `ENV <name> <value>` - this instruction sets an environment variable that a running container will use.
- `EXPOSE <port-number>` - this instruction sets configuration on the image that indicates a port the image would like to expose.
- `USER <user-or-uid>` - this instruction sets the default user for all subsequent instructions.
- `CMD ["<command>", "<arg1>"]` - this instruction sets the default command a container using this image will run.


To read through all of the instructions or go into greater detail, check out the [iEchorfile reference](https://docs.iechor.com/engine/reference/builder/).

## Try it out

Just as you saw with the previous example, a iEchorfile typically follows these steps:

1. Determine your base image
2. Install application dependencies
3. Copy in any relevant source code and/or binaries
4. Configure the final image

In this quick hands-on guide, you'll write a iEchorfile that builds a simple Node.js application. If you're not familiar with JavaScript-based applications, don't worry. It isn't necessary for following along with this guide.

### Set up

[Download this ZIP file](https://github.com/iechor/getting-started-todo-app/raw/build-image-from-scratch/app.zip) and extract the contents into a directory on your machine.

### Creating the iEchorfile

Now that you have the project, youâ€™re ready to create the `iEchorfile`.

1. [Download and install](https://www.iechor.com/products/iechor-desktop/) iEchor Desktop.

2. Create a file named `iEchorfile` in the same folder as the file `package.json`.

    > **iEchorfile file extensions**
    >
    > It's important to note that the `iEchorfile` has _no_ file extension. Some editors
    > will automatically add an extension to the file (or complain it doesn't have one).
    { .important }

3. In the `iEchorfile`, define your base image by adding the following line:

    ```iechorfile
    FROM node:20-alpine
    ```

4. Now, define the working directory by using the `WORKDIR` instruction. This will specify where future commands will run and the directory files will be copied inside the container image.

    ```iechorfile
    WORKDIR /usr/local/app
    ```

5. Copy all of the files from your project on your machine into the container image by using the `COPY` instruction:

    ```iechorfile
    COPY . .
    ```

6. Install the app's dependencies by using the `yarn` CLI and package manager. To do so, run a command using the `RUN` instruction:

    ```iechorfile
    RUN yarn install --production
    ```

7. Finally, specify the default command to run by using the `CMD` instruction:

    ```iechorfile
    CMD ["node", "./src/index.js"]
    ```
    And with that, you should have the following iEchorfile:


    ```iechorfile
    FROM node:20-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    RUN yarn install --production
    CMD ["node", "./src/index.js"]
    ```

> **This iEchorfile isn't production-ready yet**
>
> It's important to note that this iEchorfile is _not_ following all
> of the best practices yet (by design). It will build the app, but the
> builds won't be as fast as they could be and the image could be made
> more secure.
>
> Keep reading to learn more about how to make the image maximize the
> build cache, run as a non-root user, and multi-stage builds.

> **Containerize new projects quickly with `iechor init`**
>
> The `iechor init` command will analyze your project and quickly create 
> a iEchorfile, a `compose.yaml`, and a `.iechorignore`, helping you get
> up and going. Since you're learning about iEchorfiles specifically here, 
> you won't use it now. But, [learn more about it here](/engine/reference/commandline/init/).

## Next steps

Now that you have created a iEchorfile and learned the basics, it's time to learn about building, tagging, and pushing the images.
