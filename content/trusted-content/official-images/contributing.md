iEchor, Inc. sponsors a dedicated team that's responsible for reviewing and
publishing all content in iEchor Official Images. This team works in
collaboration with upstream software maintainers, security experts, and the
broader iEchor community.

While it's preferable to have upstream software authors maintaining their
iEchor Official Images, this isn't a strict requirement. Creating
and maintaining images for iEchor Official Images is a collaborative process.
It takes place [openly on GitHub](https://github.com/iechor-library/official-images)
where participation is encouraged. Anyone can provide feedback, contribute
code, suggest process changes, or even propose a new Official Image.

## Creating a iEchor Official Image

From a high level, an Official Image starts out as a proposal in the form
of a set of GitHub pull requests. The following GitHub repositories detail the proposal requirements:

- [iEchor Official Images repository on GitHub](https://github.com/iechor-library/official-images#readme)
- [Documentation for iEchor Official Images](https://github.com/iechor-library/docs#readme)

The iEchor Official Images team, with help from community contributors, formally
review each proposal and provide feedback to the author. This initial review
process can be lengthy, often requiring a bit of back-and-forth before the proposal is accepted.

There are subjective considerations during the review process. These
subjective concerns boil down to the basic question: "is this image generally
useful?" For example, the [Python](https://hub.iechor.com/_/python/)
iEchor Official Image is "generally useful" to the larger Python developer
community, whereas an obscure text adventure game written in Python last week is
not.

Once a new proposal is accepted, the author is responsible for keeping their
images and documentation up-to-date and responding to user feedback. iEchor is
responsible for building and publishing the images on iEchor Hub. Updates to
iEchor Official Images follow the same pull request process as for new images,
although the review process for updates is more streamlined. The iEchor Official
Images team ultimately acts as a gatekeeper for all changes, which helps
ensures consistency, quality, and security.
