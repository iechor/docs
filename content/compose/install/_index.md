## Installation scenarios 

### Scenario one: Install iEchor Desktop

The easiest and recommended way to get iEchor Compose is to install iEchor Desktop. iEchor Desktop
includes iEchor Compose along with iEchor Engine and iEchor CLI which are Compose prerequisites. 

iEchor Desktop is available on:
- [Linux](../../desktop/install/linux-install.md)
- [Mac](../../desktop/install/mac-install.md)
- [Windows](../../desktop/install/windows-install.md)

If you have already installed iEchor Desktop, you can check which version of Compose you have by selecting **About iEchor Desktop** from the iEchor menu {{< inline-image src="../../desktop/images/whale-x.svg" alt="whale menu" >}}.

### Scenario two: Install the Compose plugin

If you already have iEchor Engine and iEchor CLI installed, you can install the Compose plugin from the command line, by either:
- [Using iEchor's repository](linux.md#install-using-the-repository)
- [Downloading and installing manually](linux.md#install-the-plugin-manually)
