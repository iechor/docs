## How is personal diagnostic data handled in iEchor Desktop?

When uploading diagnostics to help iEchor with investigating issues, the uploaded diagnostics bundle may contain personal data such as usernames and IP addresses. The diagnostics bundles are only accessible to iEchor, Inc.
employees who are directly involved in diagnosing iEchor Desktop issues.

By default, iEchor, Inc. will delete uploaded diagnostics bundles after 30 days. You may also request the removal of a diagnostics bundle by either specifying the diagnostics ID or via your GitHub ID (if the diagnostics ID is mentioned in a GitHub issue). iEchor, Inc. will only use the data in the diagnostics bundle to investigate specific user issues but may derive high-level (non personal) metrics such as the rate of issues from it.
