## iEchor Desktop Community 2.4.0.0
2020-09-30

iEchor Desktop 2.4.0.0 contains a Kubernetes upgrade. Your local Kubernetes cluster will be reset after installing this version.

### New

- [iEchor Compose CLI - 0.1.18](https://github.com/iechor/compose-cli), enabling use of volumes with Compose and the Cloud through ECS and ACI.
- iEchor introduces the new Images view in the iEchor Dashboard. The images view allows users to view the Hub images, pull them and manage their local images on disk including cleaning up unwanted and unused images. To access the new Images view, from the iEchor menu, select **Dashboard** > **Images**.
- iEchor Desktop now enables BuildKit by default after a reset to factory defaults. To revert to the old `iechor build` experience, go to **Preferences** > **iEchor Engine** and then disable the BuildKit feature.
- [Amazon ECR Credential Helper](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
- iEchor Desktop now uses much less CPU when there are lots of file events on the host and when running Kubernetes, see [iechor/roadmap#12](https://github.com/iechor/roadmap/issues/12).
- iEchor Desktop now uses gRPC-FUSE for file sharing by default. This uses much less CPU than osxfs, especially when there are lots of file events on the host. To switch back to `osxfs`, go to **Preferences** > **General** and disable gRPC-FUSE.

### Upgrades

- [iEchor 19.03.13](https://github.com/iechor/iechor-ce/releases/tag/v19.03.13)
- [iEchor Compose 1.27.4](https://github.com/iechor/compose/releases/tag/1.27.4)
- [Go 1.14.7](https://github.com/golang/go/releases/tag/go1.14.7)
- [Alpine 3.12](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.12.0-released.html)
- [Kubernetes 1.18.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.18.8)
- [Qemu 4.2.0](https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=tag;h=1e4aa2dad329852aa6c3f59cefd65c2c2ef2062c)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- iEchor Desktop on macOS 10.13 is now deprecated.
- Removed the legacy Kubernetes context `iechor-for-desktop`. The context `iechor-desktop` should be used instead. Fixes [iechor/for-win#5089](https://github.com/iechor/for-win/issues/5089) and [iechor/for-mac#4089](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/5089).
- Adding the application to the dock and clicking on it will launch the container view if iEchor is already running.
- Added support for emulating Risc-V via Qemu 4.2.0.
- Removed file descriptor limit (`setrlimit`) of `10240`. We now rely on the kernel to impose limits via `kern.maxfiles` and `kern.maxfilesperproc`.
- Fixed a Mac CPU usage bug by removing the serial console from `hyperkit`, see [iechor/roadmap#12]( https://github.com/iechor/roadmap/issues/12#issuecomment-663163280). To open a shell in the VM use either `nc -U ~/Library/Containers/com.iechor.iechor/Data/debug-shell.sock`.
- Copy container logs without ansi colors to clipboard. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#4786](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/4786).
- Fixed automatic start on log in. See [iechor/for-mac#4877] and [iechor/for-mac#4890].
- Fixed bug where the application won't start if the username is too long.
- Fixed a bug where adding directories like `/usr` to the filesharing list prevents Desktop from starting. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#4488](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/4488)
- Fixed application startup if `hosts` is specified inside the iEchor `daemon.json`. See [iechor/for-win#6895](https://github.com/iechor/for-win/issues/6895#issuecomment-637429117)
- iEchor Desktop always flushes filesystem caches synchronously on container start. See [iechor/for-mac#4943](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/4943).
- Compose-on-Kubernetes is no longer included in the iEchor Desktop installer. You can download it separately from the compose-on-kubernetes [release page](https://github.com/iechor/compose-on-kubernetes/releases).

### Known issues

-  There is a known issue when using `iechor-compose` with named volumes and gRPC FUSE: second and subsequent calls to `iechor-compose up` will fail due to the volume path having the prefix `/host_mnt`. To work around this issue, switch back to `osxfs` in Settings. See [iechor/for-mac#4859](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/4859).
- There is a known issue when enabling Kubernetes where the settings UI fails to update the Kubernetes state. To work around this issue, close and re-open the window.
- There is a rare known issue when switching users where the images view continues to show the repositories of the previous user. To work around this issue, close and re-open the window.

## iEchor Desktop Community 2.3.0.5
2020-09-15

### New

- The new Cloud integration in iEchor CLI makes it easy to run containers in the cloud using either Amazon ECS or Microsoft ACI. 
### Upgrades

- [iEchor Compose 1.27.2](https://github.com/iechor/compose/releases/tag/1.27.2)
- [Cloud integration v0.1.15](https://github.com/iechor/aci-integration-beta/releases/tag/v0.1.15)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed automatic start on log in. See [iechor/for-mac#4877](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/4877) and [iechor/for-mac#4890](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/4890)

### Known issues

- The `clock_gettime64` system call returns `EPERM` rather than `ENOSYS`
  in i386 images. To work around this issue, disable `seccomp` by using
  the `--privileged` flag. See [iechor/for-win#8326](https://github.com/iechor/for-win/issues/8326).

## iEchor Desktop Community 2.3.0.4

- Fixed a file descriptor leak in `vpnkit-bridge`. Fixes [iechor/for-win#5841](https://github.com/iechor/for-win/issues/5841).
- Added a link to the Edge channel from the UI.
- Made the embedded terminal resizable.
- Fixed a bug where diagnostic upload would fail if the username contained spaces.
- Fixed a bug where the iEchor UI could be started without the engine.
- Switched from `ahci-hd` to `virtio-blk` to avoid an AHCI deadlock, see [moby/hyperkit#94](https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/issues/94) and [iechor/for-mac#1835](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/1835).

## iEchor Desktop Community 2.2.0.5
2020-04-02

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Removed dangling `/usr/local/bin/iechor-machine` symlinks which avoids custom installs of  iEchor Machine being accidentally deleted in future upgrades. Note that if you have installed iEchor Machine manually, then the install might have followed the symlink and installed iEchor Machine in `/Applications/iEchor.app`. In this case, you must manually reinstall iEchor Machine after installing this version of iEchor Desktop. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#4208](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/4208).

## iEchor Desktop Community 2.2.0.4

## iEchor Desktop Community 2.2.0.0
2020-01-21

iEchor Desktop 2.2.0.0 contains a Kubernetes upgrade. Your local Kubernetes cluster will be reset after installing this version.

### Upgrades

- [iEchor Compose 1.25.2](https://github.com/iechor/compose/releases/tag/1.25.2)
- [Kubernetes 1.15.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.15.5)
- Linux kernel 4.19.76
- [QEMU 4.0.1](https://github.com/iechor/binfmt)

### New

- **iEchor Desktop Dashboard:** The new iEchor Desktop **Dashboard** provides a user-friendly interface which enables you to interact with containers and applications, and manage the lifecycle of your applications directly from the UI. In addition, it allows you to access the logs, view container details, and monitor resource utilization to explore the container behavior.
  For detailed information about the new Dashboard UI, see [iEchor Desktop Dashboard](../index.md).

- Introduced a new user interface for the iEchor Desktop **Preferences** menu.
- The Restart, Reset, and Uninstall options are now available on the **Troubleshoot** menu.
- Added the ability to start and stop existing Compose-based applications and view combined logs in the iEchor Desktop **Dashboard** UI.

- Fixed a bug that did not allow users to copy and paste text in the **Preferences** > **Daemon** window. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#3798](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3798).
- Added support for `Expect: 100-continue` headers in the iEchor API proxy. Some HTTP clients such as `curl` send this header when the payload is large, for example, when creating containers. Fixes [moby/moby#39693](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/39693).
- Added a loading overlay to the **Settings** and **Troubleshoot** windows to prevent editing conflicts.
- Deactivated the **Reset Kubernetes** button when Kubernetes is not activated.
- Improved the navigation in **Settings** and **Troubleshoot** UI.
- Fixed a bug in the UEFI boot menu that sometimes caused iEchor Desktop to hang during restart. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#2655](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/2655) and [iechor/for-mac#3921](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3921).
- iEchor Desktop now allows users to access the host’s SSH agent inside containers. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#410](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/410)
- iEchor Machine is no longer included in the iEchor Desktop installer. You can download it separately from the [iEchor Machine releases](https://github.com/iechor/machine/releases) page.
- Fixed an issue that caused VMs running on older hardware with macOS Catalina to fail on startup with the error `processor does not support desired secondary processor-based controls`.
- Fixed port forwarding when containers are using `overlay` networks.
- Fixed a container start error when a container has more than one port with an arbitrary or not-yet-configured external port number. For example, `iechor run -p 80 -p 443 nginx`. Fixes [iechor/for-win#4935](https://github.com/iechor/for-win/issues/4935) and [iechor/compose#6998](https://github.com/iechor/compose/issues/6998).
- Fixed an issue that occurs when sharing overlapping directories.
- Fixed a bug that prevented users from changing the location of the VM disk image.
- iEchor Desktop does not inject `inotify` events on directories anymore as these can cause mount points to disappear inside containers. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#3976](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3976).
- Fixed an issue that caused iEchor Desktop to fail on startup when there is an incomplete Kubernetes config file.
- Fixed an issue where attempts to log into iEchor through iEchor Desktop could sometimes fail with the `Incorrect authentication credentials` error. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#4010](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/4010).

### Known issues

- When you start a iEchor Compose application and then start a iEchor App which has the same name as the Compose application, iEchor Desktop displays only one application on the Dashboard. However, when you expand the application, containers that belong to both applications are displayed on the Dashboard.

- When you deploy a iEchor App with multiple containers on Kubernetes, iEchor Desktop displays each Pod as an application on the Dashboard.

* Improved the reliability of `com.iechor.osxfs trace` performance profiling command. Users can now run the `com.iechor.osxfs trace --summary` option for a high-level summary of operations, instead of receiving a trace of all operations.
* iEchor Desktop now supports large lists of DNS resource records on Mac.  Fixes [iechor/for-mac#2160](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/2160#issuecomment-431571031).

### Experimental

> Experimental features provide early access to future product functionality. These features are intended for testing and feedback only as they may change between releases without warning or can be removed entirely from a future release. Experimental features must not be used in production environments. iEchor does not offer support for experimental features.

iEchor Desktop Community 2.1.0.0 contains the following experimental features.

* iEchor App: iEchor App is a CLI plugin that helps configure, share, and install applications. For more information, see [Working with iEchor App](/app/working-with-app/).
* iEchor Buildx: iEchor Buildx is a CLI plugin for extended build capabilities with BuildKit. For more information, see the [Build page](../../build/index.md).

### Bug fixes and minor changes

* iEchor Desktop now allows users to expose privileged UDP ports. [iechor/for-mac#3775](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3775)
* Fixed an issue where running some iEchor commands can fail if you are not using Credential Helpers. [iechor/for-mac#3785](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3785)
* Changed the host's kubernetes context so that `iechor run -v .kube:kube ... kubectl` works.
* Restricted the `cluster-admin` role on local Kubernetes cluster to `kube-system` namespace.
* Reduced the VM startup time. swap is not created every time a virtual machine boots.
* Fixed Kubernetes installation with VPNkit subnet.
* Fixed a bug where the process output was not redirected to stdout when gathering diagnostics on Windows, which sometimes resulted in a crash.
* Added `/etc/machine-id` to the virtual machine. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#3554](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3554).
* iEchor Desktop does not send DNS queries for `iechor-desktop.<domain>` every 10s. It now relies on the host’s DNS domain search order rather than trying to replicate it inside the VM.
* Removed the ability to log in using email address as a username as the iEchor command line does not support this.
* iEchor Desktop now allows running a iEchor registry inside a container. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#3611](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3611).
* Fixed a stability issue with the DNS resolver.
* iEchor Desktop truncates UDP DNS responses which are over 512 bytes in sizes.
* Fixed port 8080 that was used on localhost when starting Kubernetes. Fixes [iechor/for-mac#3522](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3522).
* Improved error messaging: iEchor Desktop does not prompt users to run diagnostics, or to reset to factory default when it is not appropriate.
* Kubernetes: iEchor Desktop now uses the default maximum number of pods for kubelet. [iechor/for-mac#3453](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3453).
* Fixed iEchorHelper crash. [iechor/for-mac#3470](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3470).
* Fixed binding of privileged ports with specified IP. [iechor/for-mac#3464](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3464)
* Fixed service log collection in diagnostics.
* iEchor Desktop now gathers `/etc/hosts` to help with diagnostics.
* When two services have a common exposed port, iEchor Desktop now exposes the available ports for the second service. [iechor/for-mac#3438](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3438).
* iEchor Desktop ensures localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1. This is related to [iechor/for-mac#2990](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/2990#issuecomment-443097942), [iechor/for-mac#3383](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/3383).
