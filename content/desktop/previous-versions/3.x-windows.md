### New

**Dev Environments Preview**: Dev Environments enable you to seamlessly collaborate with your team members without moving between Git branches to get your code onto your team members' machines.

For more information and for instructions on how to use Dev Environments, see [Development Environments Preview](../dev-environments/index.md).

**Compose V2 beta**: iEchor Desktop now includes the beta version of Compose V2, which supports the `iechor compose` command as part of the iEchor CLI. While `iechor-compose` is still supported and maintained, Compose V2 implementation relies directly on the compose-go bindings which are maintained as part of the specification. The compose command in the iEchor CLI supports most of the `iechor-compose` commands and flags. It is expected to be a drop-in replacement for `iechor-compose`. There are a few remaining flags that have yet to be implemented, see the [iechor-compose compatibility list](../../compose/migrate.md) for more information about the flags that are supported in the new compose command. If you run into any problems with Compose V2, you can easily switch back to Compose v1 by either by making changes in iEchor Desktop **Experimental** Settings, or by running the command `iechor-compose disable-v2`. Let us know your feedback on the new ‘compose’ command by creating an issue in the [Compose-CLI](https://github.com/iechor/compose-cli/issues) GitHub repository.

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed an unexpected EOF error when trying to start a non-existing container with `-v /var/run/iechor.sock:`. See [iechor/for-mac#5025](https://github.com/iechor/for-mac/issues/5025).

### Known issues
