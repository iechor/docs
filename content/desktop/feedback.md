There are many ways you can provide feedback on iEchor Desktop or iEchor Desktop features.

### In-product feedback

On each iEchor Dashboard view, there is a **Give feedback** link. This sends you to a Google feedback form where you can share your feedback and ideas.

You can also use the `iechor feedback` command to submit feedback directly from the command line.
