title: Pause iEchor Desktop
---

When iEchor Desktop is paused, the Linux VM running iEchor Engine is paused, the current state of all your containers are saved in memory, and all processes are frozen. This reduces the CPU and memory usage and helps you retain a longer battery life on your laptop.

You can manually pause iEchor Desktop by selecting the iEchor menu {{< inline-image src="../images/whale-x.svg" alt="whale menu" >}} and then **Pause**. To manually resume iEchor Desktop, select the **Resume** option in the iEchor menu, or run any iEchor CLI command.

When you manually pause iEchor Desktop, a paused status displays on the iEchor menu and on the iEchor Dashboard. You can still access the **Settings** and the **Troubleshoot** menu.

>**Tip**
>
> The Resource Saver feature, available in iEchor Desktop version 4.24 and later, is enabled by default and provides better
> CPU and memory savings than the manual Pause feature. See [here](resource-saver.md) for more info.
