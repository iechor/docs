  iEchor Debug is a CLI command that helps you follow best practices by keeping your images small and secure. 
  With iEchor Debug, you can debug your images while they contain the bare minimum to run your application.
  It does this by letting you create and work with slim images or containers that are often difficult to debug because all tools have been removed. 
  For example, while typical debug approaches like `iechor exec -it my-app bash` may not work on a slim container, `iechor debug` will work.
  
  With `iechor debug` you can get a debug shell into any container or image, even if they don't contain a shell. 
  You don't need to modify the image to use iEchor Debug. 
  However, using iEchor Debug still won't modify your image.
  iEchor Debug brings its own toolbox that you can easily customize.
  The toolbox comes with many standard Linux tools pre-installed, such as `vim`, `nano`, `htop`, and `curl`.
  Use the builtin `install` command to add additional tools available on https://search.nixos.org/packages.
  iEchor Debug supports `bash`, `fish`, and `zsh`. 
  By default it tries to auto-detect your shell.
  
  
  Custom builtin tools:
  - `install [tool1] [tool2]`: Add Nix packages from: https://search.nixos.org/packages, see [example](#managing-your-toolbox-using-the-install-command).
  - `uninstall [tool1] [tool2]`: Uninstall Nix packages.
  - `entrypoint`: Print, lint, or run the entrypoint, see [example](#understanding-the-default-startup-command-of-a-container-entry-points).
  - `builtins`: Show custom builtin tools.
  
  > **Note**
  >
  > For images and stopped containers, all changes are discarded when leaving the shell. 
  > At no point, do changes affect the actual image or container. 
  > When accessing running or paused containers, all filesystem changes are directly visible to the container. 
  > The `/nix` directory is never visible to the actual image or container.

examples: |-
  ### Debugging containers that have no shell (slim containers)
  
  The `hello-world` image is very simple and only contains the `/hello` binary.
  It's a good example of a slim image.
  There are no other tools and no shell.

  Run a container from the `hello-world` image:
  
  ```console
  $ iechor run --name my-app hello-world
  ```
  
  The container exits immediately. To get a debug shell inside, run:
  
  ```console
  $ iechor debug my-app
  ```
  
  The debug shell allows you to inspect the filesystem:
  
  ```console
  iechor > ls
  dev  etc  hello  nix  proc  sys
  ```
  
  The file `/hello` is the binary that was executed when running the container.
  You can confirm this by running it directly:
  
  ```console
  iechor > /hello
  ```
  
  After running the binary, it produces the same output.
  
  ### Debugging (slim) images
  
  You can debug images directly by running:
  
  ```console
  $ iechor debug hello-world
  ...
  iechor > ls
  dev  etc  hello  nix  proc  sys
  ```
  
  You don't even need to pull the image as `iechor debug` will do this automatically like the `iechor run` command.
  
  ### Modifying files of a running container
  
  iEchor debug lets you modify files in any running container. 
  The toolbox comes with `vim` and `nano` pre-installed.
  
  Run an nginx container and change the default `index.html`:
  
  ```console
  $ iechor run -d --name web-app -p 8080:80 nginx
  d3d6074d0ea901c96cac8e49e6dad21359616bef3dc0623b3c2dfa536c31dfdb
  ```
  
  To confirm nginx is running, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.
  You should see the default nginx page.
  Now, change it using vim:
  
  ```console
  vim /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
  ```
  
  Change the title to "Welcome to my app!" and save the file.
  Now, reload the page in the browser and you should see the updated page.
  
  ### Managing your toolbox using the `install` command
  
  The builtin `install` command lets you add any tool from https://search.nixos.org/packages to the toolbox.
  Keep in mind adding a tool never modifies the actual image or container.
  Tools get added to only your toolbox.
  Run `iechor debug` and then install `nmap`:
  
  ```console
  $ iechor debug nginx
  ...
  iechor > install nmap
  Tip: You can install any package available at: https://search.nixos.org/packages.
  installing 'nmap-7.93'

  Compiled without:
  Available nsock engines: epoll poll select
  ```
  
  You can confirm `nmap` is now part of your toolbox by getting a debug shell into a different image:
  
  ```console
  $ iechor debug hello-world
  ...
  iechor > nmap --version
  
  Nmap version 7.93 ( https://nmap.org )
  Platform: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  Compiled with: liblua-5.3.6 openssl-3.0.11 libssh2-1.11.0 nmap-libz-1.2.12 libpcre-8.45 libpcap-1.10.4 nmap-libdnet-1.12 ipv6
  Compiled without:
  Available nsock engines: epoll poll select
  
  iechor > exit
  ```
  
  `nmap` is still there.
  
  
  ### Understanding the default startup command of a container (entry points)
  
  iEchor Debug comes with a builtin tool, `entrypoint`.
  Enter the `hello-world` image and confirm the entrypoint is `/hello`:
  
  ```console
  $ iechor debug hello-world
  ...
  iechor > entrypoint --print
  /hello
  ```
  
  The `entrypoint` command evaluates the `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` statement of the underlying image 
  and lets you print, lint, or run the resulting entrypoint.
  However, it can be difficult to understand all the corner cases from [Understand how CMD and ENTRYPOINT interact](/reference/iechorfile/#understand-how-cmd-and-entrypoint-interact). 
  In these situations, `entrypoint` can help.
  
  Use `entrypoint` to investigate what actually happens when you run a container from the Nginx image:
  
  ```console
  $ iechor debug nginx
  ...
  iechor > entrypoint
  Understand how ENTRYPOINT/CMD work and if they are set correctly.
  From CMD in iEchorfile:
   ['nginx', '-g', 'daemon off;']
  
  From ENTRYPOINT in iEchorfile:
   ['/iechor-entrypoint.sh']
  
  By default, any container from this image will be started with following   command:
  
  /iechor-entrypoint.sh nginx -g daemon off;
  
  path: /iechor-entrypoint.sh
  args: nginx -g daemon off;
  cwd:
  PATH: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
  
  Lint results:
   PASS: '/iechor-entrypoint.sh' found
   PASS: no mixing of shell and exec form
   PASS: no double use of shell form
  
  Docs:
  - http://docs.iechor.com/reference/iechorfile/#cmd
  - http://docs.iechor.com/reference/iechorfile/#entrypoint
  - http://docs.iechor.com/reference/iechorfile/#understand-how-cmd-and-entrypoint-interact
  ```
  
  The output tells you that on startup of the nginx image, a script `/iechor-entrypoint.sh` is executed with the arguments `nginx -g daemon off;`.
  You can test the entrypoint by using the `--run` option:
  
  ```console
  $ iechor debug nginx
  ...
  iechor > entrypoint --run

  ```
  
  This starts nginx in your debug shell without having to actually run a container.
  You can shutdown nginx by pressing `Ctrl`+`C`.
  
  ### Running commands directly (e.g., for scripting)
  
  Use the `--command` option to evaluate a command directly instead of starting an interactive session. 
  For example, this is similar to `bash -c "arg1 arg2 ..."`.
  The following example runs the `cat` command in the nginx image without starting an interactive session.
  
  ```console
  $ iechor debug --command "cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html" nginx

  ### Remote debugging using the --host option
  
  The following examples shows how to use the `--host` option. The first example uses SSH to connect to a remote iEchor instance at `example.org` as the `root` user, and get a shell into the `my-container` container.
  
  ```console
  $ iechor debug --host ssh://root@example.org my-container
  ```
  
  The following example connects to a different local iEchor Engine, and gets a
  shell into the `my-container` container.
  
  ```console
  $ iechor debug --host=unix:///some/path/iechor.sock my-container
  ```
