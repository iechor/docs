command: iechor swarm unlock
short: Unlock swarm
long: |-
    Unlocks a locked manager using a user-supplied unlock key. This command must be
    used to reactivate a manager after its iEchor daemon restarts if the autolock
    setting is turned on. The unlock key is printed at the time when autolock is
    enabled, and is also available from the `iechor swarm unlock-key` command.

    > **Note**
    >
    > This is a cluster management command, and must be executed on a swarm
    > manager node. To learn about managers and workers, refer to the
    > [Swarm mode section](/engine/swarm/) in the
    > documentation.
