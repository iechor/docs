    ### Remove a stopped node from the swarm

    ```console
    $ iechor node rm swarm-node-02

    Node swarm-node-02 removed from swarm
    ```

    ### Attempt to remove a running node from a swarm

    Removes the specified nodes from the swarm, but only if the nodes are in the
    down state. If you attempt to remove an active node you will receive an error:

    ```console
    $ iechor node rm swarm-node-03

    Error response from daemon: rpc error: code = 9 desc = node swarm-node-03 is not
    down and can't be removed
    ```

    ### Forcibly remove an inaccessible node from a swarm (--force) {#force}

    If you lose access to a worker node or need to shut it down because it has been
    compromised or is not behaving as expected, you can use the `--force` option.
    This may cause transient errors or interruptions, depending on the type of task
    being run on the node.

    ```console
    $ iechor node rm --force swarm-node-03

    Node swarm-node-03 removed from swarm
    ```

    A manager node must be demoted to a worker node (using `iechor node demote`)
    before you can remove it from the swarm.
